It will hear testimony from Sudhakar Ramakrishna, the president and chief executive officer of SolarWinds, and Microsoft Corp. President Brad Smith, in addition to Crowdstrike Holdings Inc. CEO George Kurtz and Kevin Mandia, CEO of FireEye Inc. -- the firm that first detected and disclosed the cyber-attack in December.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n While the attack appears to have been carried out for the purposes of espionage, Warner warned that the hackers had the capability to use the compromised software in a destructive manner, allowing them to “potentially shut down a number of these enterprises.”\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n The hackers who perpetrated the attack delivered malicious software updates to as many as 18,000 SolarWinds’s customers. Using this access, they broke into the networks at least nine federal agencies, including the departments of State, Treasury, Homeland Security, Commerce and Energy. In addition, approximately 100 private-sector companies were breached, according to the White House -- which is leading an ongoing investigation into the breach and has yet to determine its full scale.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n The attackers exhibited sophistication and patience, SolarWinds’ Ramakrishna said in Monday remarks at a virtual conference hosted by the Center for Strategic and International Studies. The hackers practiced their techniques on older and less-scrutinized servers before installing malicious code in more current updates that were being actively downloaded by customers, he said.\\n</p>\\n<h1>\\n <a id=\"_Solarium_Commission_looks\">\\n </a>\\n <a id=\"_Biden_to_sign\">\\n </a>\\n <a id=\"_France:_Russian_state\">\\n </a>\\n Lawmakers to roll out legislation reorganizing State cyber office\\n</h1>\\n<p>\\n Maggie Miller,\\n <em>\\n  The Hill\\n </em>\\n , February 23, 2021\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/539964-lawmakers-to-roll-out-legislation-reorganizing-state-cyber-office\">\\n  https://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/539964-lawmakers-to-roll-out-legislation-reorganizing-state-cyber-office\\n </a>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n A group of bipartisan lawmakers led by House Foreign Affairs Committee ranking member Michael McCaul (R-Texas) will reintroduce legislation Tuesday intended to increase the ability of the State Department to address international cybersecurity cooperation issues.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n The Cyber Diplomacy Act, first introduced in 2017, would require the State Department to open a Bureau of International Cyberspace Policy. The head of the new office would be appointed by the president and given the rank of ambassador. The position would report directly to either the Secretary of State or a deputy.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n The bureau would be tasked with leading the agency’s cybersecurity efforts, including through creating an international strategy to guide efforts by the United States to engage with other nations on cybersecurity issues and set norms on responsible behavior in cyberspace.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n The bill was introduced a month after former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced the establishment of the Bureau of Cyberspace Security and Emerging Technology (CSET) in the final days of the Trump administration.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n The office was meant to fill the void left by former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson’s decision to merge the State Department’s Office of the Cyber Coordinator with another office.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n Members of Congress on both sides of the aisle, including McCaul, immediately pushed back over the past month amid concerns that CSET was rushed through and not organized in a way that best promotes cyber diplomacy efforts. A State Department spokesperson told The Hill earlier this month that CSET was being reexamined in terms of its “mission and scope.”\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n A spokesperson for McCaul told The Hill that they had discussed the new legislation with the State Department, and that they were “optimistic the Cyber Diplomacy Act can be instructive” as CSET gets set up.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n The legislation is also sponsored by House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Gregory Meeks (D-N.Y.), along with Reps. Mike Gallagher (R-Wis.) and Jim Langevin (D-R.I.).\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n The legislation will at least initially move quickly, with the House Foreign Affairs Committee including the bill on its list of items set to be discussed during its first markup of the year later this week.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n Langevin, who chairs the House Armed Services Committee’s newly created cybersecurity subcommittee, told The Hill earlier this month that he had spoken with Jake Sullivan, President Biden’s national security advisor, on the need to reorganize the cyber bureau at the State Department.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n “The Trump administration, they were a train wreck when it came to international cyber diplomacy and policy,” Langevin said at the time. “We ceded a lot of ground to our enemies and adversaries and international policymaking entities.”\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n Advocates for the legislation have increasingly cited the need for better organization at the State Department to confront cybersecurity threats in the wake of what has become known as the SolarWinds breach. The massive Russian cyber espionage compromised much of the federal government, including the State Department, for over a year.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n President Biden last week called on the U.S. and other democratic nations to create “rules” on cyber and tech issues, particularly in confronting threats from both Russia and China.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n “Addressing Russian recklessness and hacking into computer networks in the United States and across Europe and the world has become critical to protecting our collective security,” Biden said during the virtual Munich Security Conference.\\n</p>\\n<h1>\\n <a id=\"_North_Korea_tried_1\">\\n </a>\\n</h1>\\n<h1>\\n Lawmakers Call for Ambassador to Represent U.S. in Cyberspace\\n</h1>\\n<p>\\n David Uberti,\\n <em>\\n  The Wall Street Journal\\n </em>\\n , February 23, 2021\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/lawmakers-call-for-ambassador-to-represent-u-s-in-cyberspace-11614076201\">\\n  https://www.wsj.com/articles/lawmakers-call-for-ambassador-to-represent-u-s-in-cyberspace-11614076201\\n </a>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n A group of congressional lawmakers is renewing its call for a cyber ambassador in the State Department, reviving a bill that created friction between Congress and the Trump administration.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n Lawmakers including Reps. Michael McCaul, (R., Texas), Gregory Meeks, (D., N.Y.) and Jim Langevin (D., R.I.) are planning to introduce an updated version of the Cyber Diplomacy Act on Tuesday. The bill proposes a centralized cyber bureau headed by an ambassador who would advise the Secretary of State on cyber strategy, push U.S. digital economic interests and lead international responses to security incidents.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n “We need to establish cyber norms—what’s acceptable and unacceptable in cyberspace,” Mr. Langevin said. “It starts with international diplomacy.”\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n The ambassador would act as a liaison to foreign officials, federal agencies and private companies, some of which have called for greater collaboration between governments to deter attacks. The official’s proposed mandate also includes promoting regulations that benefit U.S. businesses and protecting human rights.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n Congressional aides say the bureau would mimic and elevate the former Office of the Coordinator for Cyber Issues, which the Obama administration created in 2011 and the Trump administration disbanded in 2017.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n Christopher Painter, who led the office, said that creating the bureau pushed allies in Europe and elsewhere to similarly bolster their diplomatic ranks. A dedicated office would signal that international engagement is a priority in response to incidents such as the hack of Texas-based software provider SolarWinds Corp. , he said.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n Other governments’ cyber diplomatic efforts “have been gaining resources and power and scope—ours has not,” Mr. Painter said. “With our adversaries, it’s creating a bit of an opening.”\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n Previous versions of the Cyber Diplomacy Act passed the House of Representatives in 2018 and the House Foreign Affairs Committee in 2019. But legislators’ vision for a permanent bureau that would combine security, economic and human rights issues ran into resistance from the State Department.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n In January, then-Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced the creation of a Bureau of Cyberspace Security and Emerging Technologies, which would view cyber issues largely through the lens of national security.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n Some cyber experts warn such a focus would prevent the office from evaluating economic and security questions that often overlap. Congressional aides from both parties also said the timing of the move was puzzling given that it came just two weeks before President Biden was sworn in. The Government Accountability Office, a nonpartisan research arm of Congress, reported that the State Department kept other agencies in the dark and “did not demonstrate that it used data and evidence” in devising its approach.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n State Department Comptroller Jeffrey Mounts wrote in response to the GAO that fears of cyber issues falling into silos were overstated.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n The Biden administration has yet to signal if and how it will form the office. Secretary of State Antony Blinken has expressed support for the bureau, a State Department spokeswoman said in a statement, but he is still evaluating its potential placement and responsibilities within the agency.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n The House Committee on Foreign Affairs is slated to consider potential amendments to the Cyber Diplomacy Act on Thursday, according to the House clerk’s website.\\n</p>\\n<h1>\\n <a id=\"_Hacked_Florida_water\">\\n </a>\\n <a id=\"_Cybersecurity_spending_for\">\\n </a>\\n DHS announces new measures to boost nation\\'s cybersecurity\\n</h1>\\n<p>\\n Maggie Miller,\\n <em>\\n  The Hill\\n </em>\\n , February 22, 2021\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/539943-dhs-announces-new-measures-to-boost-nations-cybersecurity\">\\n  https://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/539943-dhs-announces-new-measures-to-boost-nations-cybersecurity\\n </a>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) on Monday announced a range of steps it will take to bolster the nation’s cybersecurity posture, including increasing funding for key cybersecurity issues.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n “Cybersecurity is more important than ever, and we will build on the Department’s excellent work as we transform our whole-of-government approach to tackle the challenge we face as a nation,” DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said in a statement.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n As part of its focus on cybersecurity, DHS announced Monday that Mayorkas would increase cybersecurity spending through Federal Emergency Management Agency grant awards. The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) will also evaluate what other resources it needs to protect the nation’s critical infrastructure against cyber threats.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n DHS noted that Mayorkas plans to promote CISA’s new ransomware awareness program, rolled out last month. The U.S. Secret Service will use its Cyber Fraud Task Forces to go after hackers involved in ransomware attacks, which have become an increasing headache for hospitals, schools and other critical organizations over the past year.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n In addition, Mayorkas will appear at a range of events both later this week and over the upcoming month to highlight cybersecurity issues, including the need to build a diverse workforce, and will engage with international partners on defending the nation against cyber threats.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n “This week is just the beginning of a series of actions we will pursue nationally and internationally to improve cybersecurity at all levels,” Mayorkas said Monday.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n Mayorkas described cybersecurity as one of his “highest priorities” during his Senate nomination hearing last month and was praised by members of Congress and cyber experts for his understanding of the threats in cyberspace.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Bennie Thompson (D-Miss.) and Rep. Yvette Clarke (D-N.Y.), the chair of the panel’s cybersecurity subcommittee, both applauded the efforts by DHS to prioritize cybersecurity.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n “For several years, the Federal government has underestimated the cyber threats posed to state and local networks and neglected the federal government’s responsibility to help defend them,” Thompson and Clarke said in a joint statement on Monday. “Inaction has proven costly for victims – from Albany to Atlanta. And response to opportunistic breaches take the time away from defending against more sophisticated attacks.”\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n The lawmakers described cybersecurity threats to state and local governments as a “national security issue” and noted that they intend to work with Mayorkas in reintroducing the State and Local Cybersecurity Improvement Act.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n The bipartisan bill, which failed to be signed into law during the last Congress, would create a $400 million grant program to provide resources for state and local officials to defend against cyberattacks, which have multiplied during the COVID-19 pandemic.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n “By making strategic investments in raising the baseline cybersecurity posture of state and local governments, we can help avoid opportunistic attacks against them and free up resources to defend against more sophisticated threats,” Thompson and Clarke said.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n CISA is the key agency at DHS tasked with defending the nation’s critical infrastructure, including elections, against cyber threats.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n The agency has been building up its workforce since former Director Christopher Krebs was fired by former President Trump and multiple other top leaders were forced to step down after CISA’s efforts to push back against disinformation and misinformation around the 2020 election.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n Nitin Natarajan was confirmed last week to take over as deputy director of CISA, while the agency announced Monday that Eric Goldstein would take over as executive director for Cybersecurity and David Mussington would take over as executive assistant director for Infrastructure Security.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n “CISA is gaining strong advocates and leaders with these appointments, and I welcome them to the team,” CISA Acting Executive Director Brandon Wales said Monday in a statement. “Their appointments this early in the new administration signals a commitment to CISA’s mission and the recognition of our role in defending the nation’s critical infrastructure against cyber and physical threats.”\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n While President Biden has not yet formally nominated an individual to serve as director, Reuters reported last month that he intends to put forward Rob Silvers, a former Obama administration official, for the position.\\n</p>\\n<h1>\\n <a id=\"_Justice_Department_charges\">\\n </a>\\n <a id=\"_Lawmakers_introduce_bipartisan\">\\n </a>\\n <a id=\"_Industry_groups_urge\">\\n </a>\\n</h1>\\n<p>\\n <a id=\"_Defense_industry_group\">\\n </a>\\n <a id=\"_Solving_for_DOD\\'s\">\\n </a>\\n <a id=\"_Langevin_eyes_busy\">\\n </a>\\n <strong>\\n  Water-sector cybersecurity leader cites resource, ongoing info-sharing needs underscored by Florida hack\\n </strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n Charlie Mitchell,\\n <em>\\n  Inside Cybersecurity\\n </em>\\n , February 23, 2021\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n <a href=\"https://insidecybersecurity.com/daily-news/water-sector-cybersecurity-leader-cites-resource-ongoing-info-sharing-needs-underscored\">\\n  https://insidecybersecurity.com/daily-news/water-sector-cybersecurity-leader-cites-resource-ongoing-info-sharing-needs-underscored\\n </a>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n <a id=\"_Opinion:_Does_the\">\\n </a>\\n The hack of a Florida water utility’s computer system – and attempted poisoning of the municipal water supply – offered a painful demonstration of cybersecurity resource strains facing all kinds of critical infrastructure operators, according to Kevin Morley, a cyber policy leader and manager of federal relations for the American Water Works Association.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n “More prescriptive requirements are not the answer,” Morley said in an interview with Inside Cybersecurity. “We don’t have the resources. A lot of these systems were designed in the 1970s and ‘80’s, and they’re not going to have the cyber expertise.”\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n Morley said, “This is a critical infrastructure issue, not just a water issue. The difference with small operators is it becomes a resource issue.”\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n Further, he said the hack revealed that “information sharing is still a problem,” including the ongoing need for government to declassify more actionable material for use by critical infrastructure operators and to present intelligence from the government in “workable language. Just tell me what the problem is in plain English.”\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n The FBI is investigating the Feb. 5 incident in which a hacker accessed the Oldsmar, FL, water treatment plant’s computer system and tried to vastly increase the ratio of sodium hydroxide in the water. Authorities haven’t announced whether they’ve identified the perpetrator of a cyber attack that could have caused mass casualties.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n Lawmakers have already begun questioning oversight of cybersecurity in the water sector, while U.S. EPA – the Sector-Specific Agency for water – quickly put out best practices and resources. But questions emerged on whether direct regulation is required, an idea that Morley said largely misses the point.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n “This isn’t exclusive to water,” Morley said. “It’s applicable to all smaller critical infrastructure.”\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n He pointed to numerous efforts underway on water-sector cybersecurity and said guidance issued by EPA following the revelation of the hack “was very helpful” and that it dovetailed with AWWA’s efforts to share best practices.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n Morley’s group, AWWA, several years ago was one of the first to map the National Institute of Standards and Technology framework of cybersecurity standards to the sector’s specific needs, and AWWA provides guidance matching security steps to the equipment and devices operators are using, he said.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n “The technology is sophisticated and we need to find ways to make cyber risk management tools more accessible,” Morley said. AWWA is also working with the Department of Agriculture to provide cybersecurity training to operators of small water systems, Morley said.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n Morley also explained that water systems submit risk assessment and emergency response plans to EPA for certification under a three-tier system requiring the largest operators to report first, followed by medium and small operators. The largest systems – over 100,000 customers – were due to self-certify in December. Under provisions in the 2018 America’s Water Infrastructure Act, medium-sized operators serving 50,000 to 100,000 customers submitted their risk assessment/response plans in December and must certify in June.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n Small operators like Oldsmar are due to submit their risk assessment/response plans in June and certify in December 2021.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n The AWIA also authorized $10 million for small systems that was never appropriated by Congress, Morley observed.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n “Some people say the water infrastructure law doesn’t specifically require anything, well, you don’t know what you’ll find until you do the assessment. It says do discovery and the assessment, and have a plan for managing risk and responding,” Morley said. “Now you [the operator] own the risk and must manage it appropriately.”\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n Morley said AWWA provides “the means for utilities to approach cybersecurity in a methodological way and demonstrate due diligence. It’s a false play to say this means you’ll never have a cyber incident.”\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n Cyberspace Solarium Commission senior advisor Mark Montgomery in a separate interview last week said policymakers must raise awareness of cybersecurity issues both among water-supply operators and the local governments that own about 80 percent of the water systems, and take steps such as providing technological assistance and funding to operators facing extremely tight budgets.\\n</p>\\n<h1>\\n <a id=\"_DOD_acquisition_leaders:\">\\n </a>\\n Why America would not survive a real first strike cyberattack today\\n</h1>\\n<p>\\n Mike Rogers,\\n <em>\\n  The Hill\\n </em>\\n , February 22, 2021\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n <a href=\"https://thehill.com/opinion/cybersecurity/539826-we-would-not-survive-true-first-strike-cyberattack\">\\n  https://thehill.com/opinion/cybersecurity/539826-we-would-not-survive-true-first-strike-cyberattack\\n </a>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n If a full on “turn the lights off” cyber war were to happen today, we would lose. Think about that. We would lose a cyber war. With a few clicks of the mouse, and in just a few seconds, hackers in Beijing or Moscow could turn off our electricity, millions would lose heat, groceries would spoil, banking machines would not work, and people could not get gasoline. It would be what we have seen down in Texas, but on national scale and with no end in sight. That we have escaped a digital catastrophe thus far is not due to skill. It is due to blind luck and restraint from our adversaries.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n Just a few weeks ago, hackers attacked a water treatment plant in Florida, trying  to increase the amount of lye in the water to toxic levels. A worker was able to prevent the contamination. Luck was all that stood between hackers and a potentially deadly cyber incident. If that were not enough, we are still uncovering the full scale of the Solar Winds hack nearly three months on from its first disclosure. At least nine federal departments or agencies and over 100 companies were compromised and, as the probe continues, it remains likely that more targets are identified.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n Think about how significant this breach was. Hackers likely from Russian intelligence penetrated the software supply chain and used the software update feature to spread malicious code to more than 18,000 users. Their aim was to steal as much data and credentials as possible for their Russian interests and to undermine our own security. This almost certainly will be one of the broadest espionage efforts in history, like the Chinese theft of over 22 million background investigation records in 2015.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n The Russian attack was launched from within the United States using our servers. This was an incredibly clever way to mask the origin and ensure that our intelligence agencies would not see a foreign attack, as they are barred by law from running inside our country. Once inside government networks, the hackers monitored the way we identify and intercept their systems penetration efforts and designed an attack that made it difficult to identify. These foreign hackers know about our weak spots.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n The only thing that prevented the Russians from launching a destructive malware attack or inserting malicious code was the Russians themselves. They could have caused a major disruption across our government and private sector networks, changing or deleting data, planting viruses, or simply turning off the networks. Restarting the systems and deleting the offending code alone is not a solution. In 2016, the Ukranian electricity grid was targeted by the Russians and, until this day, the country is still finding and removing vulnerabilities left behind by Moscow.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n We had to rely on Russian restraint rather than our defenses to stop what could have been a devastating offensive attack. Sadly, we have confused luck and the restraint of our adversaries with our own skill. Policymakers, business owners, and everyday citizens are numb to the regular attacks. We assume that if they have not yet been destructive or damaging then they will never be, and that our protections are sufficient. Nothing could be further from the truth. Our adversaries are moving forth with plans to cause massive disruption. Our country should harden our defenses and offer credible deterrents. If we simply wait, it will be too late.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n We are just not prepared. For Solar Winds, the Russian hackers sat on our networks for almost a year before they were identified, taking advantage of both the law and our fragmented strategy in cybersecurity. We need a national cybersecurity director in the White House. We should harmonize our national approach to cybersecurity, deconflict the budgets, and stay laser focused on bolstering our networks from more attacks.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n This is not only a government problem. We must move toward collective defense. The private sector should not be responsible alone to stop such attacks. Firms are neither prepared nor expected to defend from enemy bombers, but they are still expected to stop the cyber equivalent of that on this daily basis. Our vulnerabilities will continue to rise with machine learning, artificial intelligence, and the internet of things.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n If we cannot get a handle on our vulnerabilities and protections today, what hope do we have in the future? The Iranians attacked our banks in 2012. Our water systems were targeted. The Russians were found in our electric grids and our government systems. Let us not wait until a major catastrophe occurs before acting. The administration needs to act. Our policymakers need to act. The countdown clock is ticking.\\n</p>\\n<h1>\\n <a id=\"_In_the_Middle\">\\n </a>\\n In the Middle East, War Is Going Digital\\n</h1>\\n<p>\\n Roxane Farmanfarmaian and Jay Mens,\\n <em>\\n  Foreign Policy\\n </em>\\n , February 22, 2021\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n <a href=\"https://foreignpolicy.com/2021/02/22/in-the-middle-east-war-is-going-digital/\">\\n  https://foreignpolicy.com/2021/02/22/in-the-middle-east-war-is-going-digital/\\n </a>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n Given this year’s news cycle, you might already have forgotten that, this past December, news broke that Russia had conducted a major hack of U.S. intelligence agencies. Around the same time, a smaller story about government-led hacking in the Middle East came out. Saudi Arabia, it was alleged, was spying on journalists from Al Jazeera, the state-funded media network of its rival Qatar, using Israeli spyware. Both stories involved cyber-infiltration and data theft. But the stories had a more important commonality: No one seemed especially shocked by them.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n The Gulf is rapidly becoming a laboratory for the ethics and practices of hybrid warfare. A new report (which one of us directed) from the Middle East and North Africa Forum at the University of Cambridge explores the drivers, and the direction, of the Gulf’s evolving strategy. With conflicting religious agendas and rival international backers, Saudi Arabia and Iran have spent almost 30 years locked in geopolitical struggle. Both have sought to build leverage over one another using methods short of war—backing regional proxies, amplifying the voices of the other’s political opposition groups, and, increasingly, using targeted cyberattacks. For both, cyberwarfare offers an ethical out—it kills less people than conventional war—but can cause great havoc and disruption.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n Saudi Arabia and Iran have very different approaches to cyberwar. Saudi Arabia has chosen to outsource most of its cyberdevelopment, purchasing bespoke tools from private contractors in the United States, Israel, and the United Kingdom to conduct specific cyberoperations. Saudi Arabia has used legions of bots to bolster the kingdom’s image on social media at times of crisis, most recently for damage control after the murder of Jamal Khashoggi. At the same time, the kingdom has attempted to strengthen its cyberdefenses, in particular by creating a broad institutional infrastructure to handle cybersecurity. In 2017, this began with the launch of a National Cybersecurity Authority, a Saudi equivalent to U.S. Cyber Command under the direct authority of the King’s office, as well as the Saudi Federation for Cybersecurity, Programming and Drones, an organization under the auspices of the Saudi Olympic Committee leading the charge to build a pool of skilled Saudi cyberwarriors.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n Iran, meanwhile, has developed its own integrated, multiplatform offensive program. Hampered by sanctions and its international pariah status, its program is mostly homegrown, though with some help from Russia and China. In 2013 China committed to helping Iran develop a national internet, known as SHOMA, independent of the World Wide Web, a partnership expected to expand with a 25-year security deal the two states are currently negotiating. Iran’s developments in the field have contributed to its status as one of the region’s most advanced cyberpowers.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n The intensification of the cyber-standoff in the Gulf holds lessons for all states regardless of their size, wealth, or ideology. For no state in the world is it a question anymore of if espionage, sabotage, and social engineering are slipping undetected into their computer networks, but rather how to address the escalating threat, and how fast.\\n</p>'"

      "The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) on Monday announced a range of steps it will take to bolster the nation’s cybersecurity posture, including increasing funding for key cybersecurity issues. \n",
      "“Cybersecurity is more important than ever, and we will build on the Department’s excellent work as we transform our whole-of-government approach to tackle the challenge we face as a nation,” DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said in a statement. \n",
      "As part of its focus on cybersecurity, DHS announced Monday that Mayorkas would increase cybersecurity spending through Federal Emergency Management Agency grant awards. The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) will also evaluate what other resources it needs to protect the nation’s critical infrastructure against cyber threats. \n",
      "DHS noted that Mayorkas plans to promote CISA’s new ransomware awareness program, rolled out last month. The U.S. Secret Service will use its Cyber Fraud Task Forces to go after hackers involved in ransomware attacks, which have become an increasing headache for hospitals, schools and other critical organizations over the past year. \n",
      "In addition, Mayorkas will appear at a range of events both later this week and over the upcoming month to highlight cybersecurity issues, including the need to build a diverse workforce, and will engage with international partners on defending the nation against cyber threats. \n",
      "“This week is just the beginning of a series of actions we will pursue nationally and internationally to improve cybersecurity at all levels,” Mayorkas said Monday.\n",
      "Mayorkas described cybersecurity as one of his “highest priorities” during his Senate nomination hearing last month and was praised by members of Congress and cyber experts for his understanding of the threats in cyberspace. \n",
      "House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Bennie Thompson (D-Miss.) and Rep. Yvette Clarke (D-N.Y.), the chair of the panel’s cybersecurity subcommittee, both applauded the efforts by DHS to prioritize cybersecurity. \n",
      "“For several years, the Federal government has underestimated the cyber threats posed to state and local networks and neglected the federal government’s responsibility to help defend them,” Thompson and Clarke said in a joint statement on Monday. “Inaction has proven costly for victims – from Albany to Atlanta. And response to opportunistic breaches take the time away from defending against more sophisticated attacks.”\n",
      "The lawmakers described cybersecurity threats to state and local governments as a “national security issue” and noted that they intend to work with Mayorkas in reintroducing the State and Local Cybersecurity Improvement Act. \n",
      "The bipartisan bill, which failed to be signed into law during the last Congress, would create a $400 million grant program to provide resources for state and local officials to defend against cyberattacks, which have multiplied during the COVID-19 pandemic.  \n",
      "“By making strategic investments in raising the baseline cybersecurity posture of state and local governments, we can help avoid opportunistic attacks against them and free up resources to defend against more sophisticated threats,” Thompson and Clarke said.  \n",
      "CISA is the key agency at DHS tasked with defending the nation’s critical infrastructure, including elections, against cyber threats. \n",
      "The agency has been building up its workforce since former Director Christopher Krebs was fired by former President Trump and multiple other top leaders were forced to step down after CISA’s efforts to push back against disinformation and misinformation around the 2020 election. \n",
      "Nitin Natarajan was confirmed last week to take over as deputy director of CISA, while the agency announced Monday that Eric Goldstein would take over as executive director for Cybersecurity and David Mussington would take over as executive assistant director for Infrastructure Security. \n",
      "“CISA is gaining strong advocates and leaders with these appointments, and I welcome them to the team,” CISA Acting Executive Director Brandon Wales said Monday in a statement. “Their appointments this early in the new administration signals a commitment to CISA’s mission and the recognition of our role in defending the nation’s critical infrastructure against cyber and physical threats.” \n",
      "While President Biden has not yet formally nominated an individual to serve as director, Reuters reported last month that he intends to put forward Rob Silvers, a former Obama administration official, for the position.\n"

A lot of us can pass through the check boxes of ‘Can do you this? Can you do that?’ but obviously the results prove that we need to do more. How can we achieve excellence versus simply being compliant?”\\n <br/>\\n <br/>\\n Third, Congress needs to “make it easy for us to communicate with the government by having a single forum or clearing house to whom we can report and have the responsibility be from there to disseminate it across government entities and the private sector entities, as opposed to us having to run from pillar to post so to speak,” Ramakrishna said.\\n <br/>\\n <br/>\\n SolarWinds is developing ways to address the hack and prevent future breaches, Ramakrishna said, specifically highlighting their work to create “parallel build systems.”\\n <br/>\\n <br/>\\n “Having different environments, different people accessing them and different techniques to build our software and then cross correlating the output of those three will essentially reduce the opportunity for a threat actor to do damage to our build systems,” Ramakrishna said. “That is going to be an involved process but we believe that is really what is required in light of these findings to be more safe and secure going forward.”\\n <br/>\\n <br/>\\n Ramakrishna said SolarWinds is “documenting” its findings and is “working with the likes of CISA and others to potentially help improve standards such as NIST and CMMC such that these are not simply compliance related guidelines but how do we truly increase the excellence in software development and development practices. That is a key area that has a connotation on both our build environments and the build processes themselves.”\\n <br/>\\n <br/>\\n The SolarWinds CEO called engagement with the U.S. government “broadly constructive if not always completely informational,” adding “I recognize government has its own restrictions on what it can share, when it can share, etc. We took a commitment to share with government and generally speaking national defenders very proactivity and we continue to do so.”\\n <br/>\\n <br/>\\n Creating a “tighter public-private partnership” would be helpful, Ramakrishna said, including “having a single entity within the government whom we can report these incidents and authority has the ability to disseminate it to whoever is invested in it and pertinent to communicate.”\\n <br/>\\n <br/>\\n Ramakrishna said, “Today as a mid-size company I find myself having to [deal] with multiple government agencies and there is an information asymmetry. When that happens we are losing time in fighting these attacks. Having a simpler structure of communication and exchange of information with a single entity would be hugely beneficial in my opinion.”\\n <br/>\\n <br/>\\n The Senate Intelligence Committee is holding a hearing today on the SolarWinds hack, featuring Ramakrishna, Microsoft president Brad Smith, FireEye’s Kevin Mandia and CrowdStrike CEO George Kurtz.\\n <br/>\\n <br/>\\n All four witnesses will also testify Friday in a joint hearing convened by the House Oversight and Homeland Security committees. -- Sara Friedman (sfriedman@iwpnews.com)\\n</p>\\n<h1>\\n <strong>\\n  <a id=\"1\">\\n  </a>\\n  Free market think tank launches initiative to develop new ICT supply chain strategy\\n </strong>\\n</h1>\\n<p>\\n Sara Friedman,\\n <em>\\n  Inside Cybersecurity\\n </em>\\n , February 23, 2021\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n <a href=\"https://insidecybersecurity.com/daily-news/free-market-think-tank-launches-initiative-develop-new-ict-supply-chain-strategy\">\\n  https://insidecybersecurity.com/daily-news/free-market-think-tank-launches-initiative-develop-new-ict-supply-chain-strategy\\n </a>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n The R Street Institute has launched the Supply Chain Markets Initiative, a new effort designed to bring together experts who will develop a supply chain strategy building upon work from the Cyberspace Solarium Commission.\\n <br/>\\n <br/>\\n “The aim of the SCMI is to recommend a cohesive national strategy for securing the information communications technology (ICT) supply chain,” R Street, a think tank advancing free market policies, said Monday in a news release. “The strategy will balance the considerations of both the American free market economy and national security, and take into full account the challenges and necessity of working with allies and private industry in the immediate future and in the long term.”\\n <br/>\\n <br/>\\n The strategy will be guided by five principles:\\n <br/>\\n <br/>\\n Security and Resilience as a Mindset\\n <br/>\\n Competitive and Free Markets\\n <br/>\\n International Partnerships and Engagement\\n <br/>\\n Transparency, Accountability and Privacy\\n <br/>\\n Access and Equity\\n <br/>\\n Public/Private Partnerships\\n <br/>\\n <br/>\\n R Street’s Tatyana Bolton spoke with Inside Cybersecurity in December about the new initiative and plans for upcoming work.\\n <br/>\\n <br/>\\n “Our goal is to come up with overarching strategy that considers national security considerations and the free market and balances those interests in order to come up with a way to move forward on China strategy as well as the ICT supply chain,” said Bolton, policy director of R Street’s Cybersecurity and Emerging Threats team.\\n <br/>\\n <br/>\\n Bolton is a former senior policy director for the Solarium Commission and her work focused on government reorganization and resilience.\\n <br/>\\n <br/>\\n “We are first going to take a look at China as a problem and how to compete with China,” Bolton said, because “it is the important and galvanizing topic that is bringing all of these people together.

A lot of these systems were designed in the 1970s and ‘80’s, and they’re not going to have the cyber expertise.”\\n <br/>\\n <br/>\\n Morley said, “This is a critical infrastructure issue, not just a water issue. The difference with small operators is it becomes a resource issue.”\\n <br/>\\n <br/>\\n Further, he said the hack revealed that “information sharing is still a problem,” including the ongoing need for government to declassify more actionable material for use by critical infrastructure operators and to present intelligence from the government in “workable language. Just tell me what the problem is in plain English.”\\n <br/>\\n <br/>\\n The FBI is investigating the Feb. 5 incident in which a hacker accessed the Oldsmar, FL, water treatment plant’s computer system and tried to vastly increase the ratio of sodium hydroxide in the water. Authorities haven’t announced whether they’ve identified the perpetrator of a cyber attack that could have caused mass casualties.\\n <br/>\\n <br/>\\n Lawmakers have already begun questioning oversight of cybersecurity in the water sector, while U.S. EPA – the Sector-Specific Agency for water – quickly put out best practices and resources. But questions emerged on whether direct regulation is required, an idea that Morley said largely misses the point.\\n <br/>\\n <br/>\\n “This isn’t exclusive to water,” Morley said. “It’s applicable to all smaller critical infrastructure.”\\n <br/>\\n <br/>\\n He pointed to numerous efforts underway on water-sector cybersecurity and said guidance issued by EPA following the revelation of the hack “was very helpful” and that it dovetailed with AWWA’s efforts to share best practices.\\n <br/>\\n <br/>\\n Morley’s group, AWWA, several years ago was one of the first to map the National Institute of Standards and Technology framework of cybersecurity standards to the sector’s specific needs, and AWWA provides guidance matching security steps to the equipment and devices operators are using, he said.\\n <br/>\\n <br/>\\n “The technology is sophisticated and we need to find ways to make cyber risk management tools more accessible,” Morley said. AWWA is also working with the Department of Agriculture to provide cybersecurity training to operators of small water systems, Morley said.\\n <br/>\\n <br/>\\n Morley also explained that water systems submit risk assessment and emergency response plans to EPA for certification under a three-tier system requiring the largest operators to report first, followed by medium and small operators. The largest systems – over 100,000 customers – were due to self-certify in December. Under provisions in the 2018 America’s Water Infrastructure Act, medium-sized operators serving 50,000 to 100,000 customers submitted their risk assessment/response plans in December and must certify in June.\\n <br/>\\n <br/>\\n Small operators like Oldsmar are due to submit their risk assessment/response plans in June and certify in December 2021.\\n <br/>\\n <br/>\\n The AWIA also authorized $10 million for small systems that was never appropriated by Congress, Morley observed.\\n <br/>\\n <br/>\\n “Some people say the water infrastructure law doesn’t specifically require anything, well, you don’t know what you’ll find until you do the assessment. It says do discovery and the assessment, and have a plan for managing risk and responding,” Morley said. “Now you [the operator] own the risk and must manage it appropriately.”\\n <br/>\\n <br/>\\n Morley said AWWA provides “the means for utilities to approach cybersecurity in a methodological way and demonstrate due diligence. It’s a false play to say this means you’ll never have a cyber incident.”\\n <br/>\\n <br/>\\n Cyberspace Solarium Commission senior advisor Mark Montgomery in a separate interview last week said policymakers must raise awareness of cybersecurity issues both among water-supply operators and the local governments that own about 80 percent of the water systems, and take steps such as providing technological assistance and funding to operators facing extremely tight budgets. – Charlie Mitchell (cmitchell@iwpnews.com)\\n</p>\\n<h1>\\n <strong>\\n  <a id=\"3\">\\n  </a>\\n  DHS and CISA introduce new team, emphasize Biden commitment to cybersecurity agenda\\n </strong>\\n</h1>\\n<p>\\n Charlie Mitchell,\\n <em>\\n  Inside Cybersecurity\\n </em>\\n , February 23, 2021\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n <a href=\"https://insidecybersecurity.com/daily-news/dhs-and-cisa-introduce-new-team-emphasize-biden-commitment-cybersecurity-agenda\">\\n  https://insidecybersecurity.com/daily-news/dhs-and-cisa-introduce-new-team-emphasize-biden-commitment-cybersecurity-agenda\\n </a>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n The Department of Homeland Security and its cyber agency are touting new members of the cybersecurity team and ways the department is pursuing “President Biden’s vision to elevate cybersecurity across the government.”\\n <br/>\\n <br/>\\n The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency in recent days has announced officials for three senior roles that do not require Senate confirmation.

       " <p>The Department of Homeland Security and its cyber agency are touting new members of the cybersecurity team and ways the department is pursuing “President Biden’s vision to elevate cybersecurity across the government.”<br/><br/>The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency in recent days has announced officials for three senior roles that do not require Senate confirmation. On Monday, CISA announced David Mussington as the new executive assistant director for infrastructure security.<br/><br/>Earlier the agency announced Nitin Natarajan for deputy director and Eric Goldstein as executive assistant director for cyber. Former DHS official Rob Silvers is expected to be nominated for CISA director but the selection has yet to be formally announced.<br/><br/>Mussington is a professor of the practice and director of the Center for Public Policy and Private Enterprise at the University of Maryland. He said in a statement, “This division fulfills a coordination and outreach role with our industry partners regarding risk and threat assessment to critical infrastructures. But these aren’t meant to be regulatory conversations. Our core mission is to be a facilitator of communication, a sharer of information, and a provider of tools for risk management.”<br/><br/>CISA said in a statement Monday, “Executive Assistant Director Mussington is an internationally known expert in critical infrastructure protection and cybersecurity -- leading projects and program analyses for US federal agencies, states, and internationally for institutions in Canada, Europe, and the United Kingdom. In an over two-decade career, he has played a variety of roles in both the public and private sectors. His research and teaching activities have focused on cyber physical system risk management, election cybersecurity, and critical infrastructure security risk management.”<br/><br/>“CISA is gaining strong advocates and leaders with these appointments, and I welcome them to the team,” said CISA Acting Director Brandon Wales. “Their appointments this early in the new administration signals a commitment to CISA’s mission and the recognition of our role in defending the nation’s critical infrastructure against cyber and physical threats.”<br/><br/>DHS also put out a statement on “the many ways [the department] will carry out President Biden’s vision to elevate cybersecurity across the government.

      "{'title': 'SolarWinds urges Congress to consider reporting incentives, ‘clearing house’ for addressing software breaches ', 'source': 'Inside Cybersecurity', 'body': 'SolarWinds CEO Sudhakar Ramakrishna emphasized that robust information sharing infrastructure is essential to effective government-industry collaboration on addressing and mitigating software breaches, at an event Monday leading up to his appearances this week on Capitol Hill.Ramakrishna highlighted three opportunities for government engagement in a conversation with former DHS cyber leader Suzanne Spaulding at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.“The first is to integrate more private-public partnership and have incentives or protections for people who are coming out and openly admitting it hacks and use them as information sources,” Ramakrishna said, citing the Cyberspace Solarium Commission’s landmark report which “referenced speed and agility as a way to thwart these kinds of attacks.”Second, Ramakrishna said Congress should “leverage the work we are doing and others are doing to enhance standards such as NIST and CMMC,” calling them “excellence-focused versus compliance-focused. A lot of us can pass through the check boxes of ‘Can do you this? Can you do that?’ but obviously the results prove that we need to do more. How can we achieve excellence versus simply being compliant?”Third, Congress needs to “make it easy for us to communicate with the government by having a single forum or clearing house to whom we can report and have the responsibility be from there to disseminate it across government entities and the private sector entities, as opposed to us having to run from pillar to post so to speak,” Ramakrishna said.SolarWinds is developing ways to address the hack and prevent future breaches, Ramakrishna said, specifically highlighting their work to create “parallel build systems.”“Having different environments, different people accessing them and different techniques to build our software and then cross correlating the output of those three will essentially reduce the opportunity for a threat actor to do damage to our build systems,” Ramakrishna said. “That is going to be an involved process but we believe that is really what is required in light of these findings to be more safe and secure going forward.”Ramakrishna said SolarWinds is “documenting” its findings and is “working with the likes of CISA and others to potentially help improve standards such as NIST and CMMC such that these are not simply compliance related guidelines but how do we truly increase the excellence in software development and development practices. That is a key area that has a connotation on both our build environments and the build processes themselves.”The SolarWinds CEO called engagement with the U.S. government “broadly constructive if not always completely informational,” adding “I recognize government has its own restrictions on what it can share, when it can share, etc. We took a commitment to share with government and generally speaking national defenders very proactivity and we continue to do so.”Creating a “tighter public-private partnership” would be helpful, Ramakrishna said, including “having a single entity within the government whom we can report these incidents and authority has the ability to disseminate it to whoever is invested in it and pertinent to communicate.”Ramakrishna said, “Today as a mid-size company I find myself having to [deal] with multiple government agencies and there is an information asymmetry. When that happens we are losing time in fighting these attacks. Having a simpler structure of communication and exchange of information with a single entity would be hugely beneficial in my opinion.”The Senate Intelligence Committee is holding a hearing today on the SolarWinds hack, featuring Ramakrishna, Microsoft president Brad Smith, FireEye’s Kevin Mandia and CrowdStrike CEO George Kurtz.All four witnesses will also testify Friday in a joint hearing convened by the House Oversight and Homeland Security committees. -- Sara Friedman (sfriedman@iwpnews.com)The R Street Institute has launched the Supply Chain Markets Initiative, a new effort designed to bring together experts who will develop a supply chain strategy building upon work from the Cyberspace Solarium Commission.“The aim of the SCMI is to recommend a cohesive national strategy for securing the information communications technology (ICT) supply chain,” R Street, a think tank advancing free market policies, said Monday in a news release. “The strategy will balance the considerations of both the American free market economy and national security, and take into full account the challenges and necessity of working with allies and private industry in the immediate future and in the long term.”The strategy will be guided by five principles:Security and Resilience as a MindsetCompetitive and Free MarketsInternational Partnerships and EngagementTransparency, Accountability and PrivacyAccess and EquityPublic/Private PartnershipsR Street’s Tatyana Bolton spoke with Inside Cybersecurity in December about the new initiative and plans for upcoming work.“Our goal is to come up with overarching strategy that considers national security considerations and the free market and balances those interests in order to come up with a way to move forward on China strategy as well as the ICT supply chain,” said Bolton, policy director of R Street’s Cybersecurity and Emerging Threats team.Bolton is a former senior policy director for the Solarium Commission and her work focused on government reorganization and resilience.“We are first going to take a look at China as a problem and how to compete with China,” Bolton said, because “it is the important and galvanizing topic that is bringing all of these people together. From there will stem all of the basic principles we all agree on, such as free markets and American leadership in ICT.”The coalition includes:Harvard Belfer Center Cyber ProjectAspen Cybersecurity ForumAnnie Fixler, Deputy Director for the Center on Cyber and Technology Innovation at the Foundation for Defense of DemocraciesCory Simpson, Adjunct Professor at Clemson University and former Senior Director for the U.S. Cyberspace Solarium Commission.David Forscey, Managing Director for the Aspen Cybersecurity GroupErica Borghard, Resident Senior Fellow for the New American Engagement Initiative at the Scowcroft Center for Strategy and Security at the Atlantic CouncilGary Corn, Program Director for the Tech, Law, and Security Program at American University’s Washington College of Law and Senior Fellow for the Cybersecurity and Emerging Threats team at R Street InstituteJames Mulvenon, Chairman of the Board for the Cyber Conflict Studies Association and former Senior Political Scientist at the RAND CorporationJeffrey Westling, Resident Fellow for Technology and Innovation at the R Street InstituteJoshua P.

A lot of these systems were designed in the 1970s and ‘80’s, and they’re not going to have the cyber expertise.”Morley said, “This is a critical infrastructure issue, not just a water issue. The difference with small operators is it becomes a resource issue.”Further, he said the hack revealed that “information sharing is still a problem,” including the ongoing need for government to declassify more actionable material for use by critical infrastructure operators and to present intelligence from the government in “workable language. Just tell me what the problem is in plain English.”The FBI is investigating the Feb. 5 incident in which a hacker accessed the Oldsmar, FL, water treatment plant’s computer system and tried to vastly increase the ratio of sodium hydroxide in the water. Authorities haven’t announced whether they’ve identified the perpetrator of a cyber attack that could have caused mass casualties.Lawmakers have already begun questioning oversight of cybersecurity in the water sector, while U.S. EPA – the Sector-Specific Agency for water – quickly put out best practices and resources. But questions emerged on whether direct regulation is required, an idea that Morley said largely misses the point.“This isn’t exclusive to water,” Morley said. “It’s applicable to all smaller critical infrastructure.”He pointed to numerous efforts underway on water-sector cybersecurity and said guidance issued by EPA following the revelation of the hack “was very helpful” and that it dovetailed with AWWA’s efforts to share best practices.Morley’s group, AWWA, several years ago was one of the first to map the National Institute of Standards and Technology framework of cybersecurity standards to the sector’s specific needs, and AWWA provides guidance matching security steps to the equipment and devices operators are using, he said.“The technology is sophisticated and we need to find ways to make cyber risk management tools more accessible,” Morley said. AWWA is also working with the Department of Agriculture to provide cybersecurity training to operators of small water systems, Morley said.Morley also explained that water systems submit risk assessment and emergency response plans to EPA for certification under a three-tier system requiring the largest operators to report first, followed by medium and small operators. The largest systems – over 100,000 customers – were due to self-certify in December. Under provisions in the 2018 America’s Water Infrastructure Act, medium-sized operators serving 50,000 to 100,000 customers submitted their risk assessment/response plans in December and must certify in June.Small operators like Oldsmar are due to submit their risk assessment/response plans in June and certify in December 2021.The AWIA also authorized $10 million for small systems that was never appropriated by Congress, Morley observed.“Some people say the water infrastructure law doesn’t specifically require anything, well, you don’t know what you’ll find until you do the assessment. It says do discovery and the assessment, and have a plan for managing risk and responding,” Morley said. “Now you [the operator] own the risk and must manage it appropriately.”Morley said AWWA provides “the means for utilities to approach cybersecurity in a methodological way and demonstrate due diligence. It’s a false play to say this means you’ll never have a cyber incident.”Cyberspace Solarium Commission senior advisor Mark Montgomery in a separate interview last week said policymakers must raise awareness of cybersecurity issues both among water-supply operators and the local governments that own about 80 percent of the water systems, and take steps such as providing technological assistance and funding to operators facing extremely tight budgets. – Charlie Mitchell (cmitchell@iwpnews.com)The Department of Homeland Security and its cyber agency are touting new members of the cybersecurity team and ways the department is pursuing “President Biden’s vision to elevate cybersecurity across the government.”The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency in recent days has announced officials for three senior roles that do not require Senate confirmation. On Monday, CISA announced David Mussington as the new executive assistant director for infrastructure security.Earlier the agency announced Nitin Natarajan for deputy director and Eric Goldstein as executive assistant director for cyber. Former DHS official Rob Silvers is expected to be nominated for CISA director but the selection has yet to be formally announced.Mussington is a professor of the practice and director of the Center for Public Policy and Private Enterprise at the University of Maryland.

To accelerate critical improvements in state and local cybersecurity, CISA will urgently evaluate and implement additional capabilities including potential new grant programs that will enable critical security investments.”House Homeland Security Chairman Bennie Thompson (D-MS) and cyber subcommittee Chairwoman Yvette Clarke (D-NY) praised the move.“For several years, the Federal government has underestimated the cyber threats posed to state and local networks and neglected the federal government’s responsibility to help defend them. Inaction has proven costly for victims -- from Albany to Atlanta. And response to opportunistic breaches take the time away from defending against more sophisticated attacks,” Thompson and Clarke said Monday.“Make no mistake, the cybersecurity challenges faced by state and local governments is a national security issue. By making strategic investments in raising the baseline cybersecurity posture of state and local governments, we can help avoid opportunistic attacks against them and free up resources to defend against more sophisticated threats,” the Democrats said. “We are encouraged to see Secretary Mayorkas taking the cyber threats to state and local networks seriously and look forward to working with him on this important issue, particularly as we prepare to reintroduce the State and Local Cybersecurity Improvement Act.”DHS also said on Monday, “On Thursday, Secretary Mayorkas will speak at the President’s Cup Cybersecurity Competition and issue a call to action to build a diverse cybersecurity workforce and leverage DHS’s partnerships to tackle the growing risk from ransomware.”The department emphasized ongoing work to confront ransomware in partnership with other agencies and allies abroad.

Just tell me what the problem is in plain English.”The FBI is investigating the Feb. 5 incident in which a hacker accessed the Oldsmar, FL, water treatment plant’s computer system and tried to vastly increase the ratio of sodium hydroxide in the water. Authorities haven’t announced whether they’ve identified the perpetrator of a cyber attack that could have caused mass casualties.Lawmakers have already begun questioning oversight of cybersecurity in the water sector, while U.S. EPA – the Sector-Specific Agency for water – quickly put out best practices and resources. But questions emerged on whether direct regulation is required, an idea that Morley said largely misses the point.“This isn’t exclusive to water,” Morley said. “It’s applicable to all smaller critical infrastructure.”He pointed to numerous efforts underway on water-sector cybersecurity and said guidance issued by EPA following the revelation of the hack “was very helpful” and that it dovetailed with AWWA’s efforts to share best practices.Morley’s group, AWWA, several years ago was one of the first to map the National Institute of Standards and Technology framework of cybersecurity standards to the sector’s specific needs, and AWWA provides guidance matching security steps to the equipment and devices operators are using, he said.“The technology is sophisticated and we need to find ways to make cyber risk management tools more accessible,” Morley said. AWWA is also working with the Department of Agriculture to provide cybersecurity training to operators of small water systems, Morley said.Morley also explained that water systems submit risk assessment and emergency response plans to EPA for certification under a three-tier system requiring the largest operators to report first, followed by medium and small operators. The largest systems – over 100,000 customers – were due to self-certify in December. Under provisions in the 2018 America’s Water Infrastructure Act, medium-sized operators serving 50,000 to 100,000 customers submitted their risk assessment/response plans in December and must certify in June.Small operators like Oldsmar are due to submit their risk assessment/response plans in June and certify in December 2021.The AWIA also authorized $10 million for small systems that was never appropriated by Congress, Morley observed.“Some people say the water infrastructure law doesn’t specifically require anything, well, you don’t know what you’ll find until you do the assessment. It says do discovery and the assessment, and have a plan for managing risk and responding,” Morley said. “Now you [the operator] own the risk and must manage it appropriately.”Morley said AWWA provides “the means for utilities to approach cybersecurity in a methodological way and demonstrate due diligence. It’s a false play to say this means you’ll never have a cyber incident.”Cyberspace Solarium Commission senior advisor Mark Montgomery in a separate interview last week said policymakers must raise awareness of cybersecurity issues both among water-supply operators and the local governments that own about 80 percent of the water systems, and take steps such as providing technological assistance and funding to operators facing extremely tight budgets. – Charlie Mitchell (cmitchell@iwpnews.com)The Department of Homeland Security and its cyber agency are touting new members of the cybersecurity team and ways the department is pursuing “President Biden’s vision to elevate cybersecurity across the government.”The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency in recent days has announced officials for three senior roles that do not require Senate confirmation. On Monday, CISA announced David Mussington as the new executive assistant director for infrastructure security.Earlier the agency announced Nitin Natarajan for deputy director and Eric Goldstein as executive assistant director for cyber. Former DHS official Rob Silvers is expected to be nominated for CISA director but the selection has yet to be formally announced.Mussington is a professor of the practice and director of the Center for Public Policy and Private Enterprise at the University of Maryland. He said in a statement, “This division fulfills a coordination and outreach role with our industry partners regarding risk and threat assessment to critical infrastructures. But these aren’t meant to be regulatory conversations. Our core mission is to be a facilitator of communication, a sharer of information, and a provider of tools for risk management.”CISA said in a statement Monday, “Executive Assistant Director Mussington is an internationally known expert in critical infrastructure protection and cybersecurity -- leading projects and program analyses for US federal agencies, states, and internationally for institutions in Canada, Europe, and the United Kingdom. In an over two-decade career, he has played a variety of roles in both the public and private sectors. His research and teaching activities have focused on cyber physical system risk management, election cybersecurity, and critical infrastructure security risk management.”“CISA is gaining strong advocates and leaders with these appointments, and I welcome them to the team,” said CISA Acting Director Brandon Wales. “Their appointments this early in the new administration signals a commitment to CISA’s mission and the recognition of our role in defending the nation’s critical infrastructure against cyber and physical threats.”DHS also put out a statement on “the many ways [the department] will carry out President Biden’s vision to elevate cybersecurity across the government. DHS will lead efforts to mitigate risks to the United States, further strengthen its partnerships with the private sector, and expand its investment in the infrastructure and people required to defend against malicious cyber attacks as part of a whole-of-government effort.”“Cybersecurity is more important than ever, and we will build on the Department’s excellent work as we transform our whole-of-government approach to tackle the challenge we face as a nation,” new DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said. “This week is just the beginning of a series of actions DHS will pursue nationally and internationally to improve cybersecurity at all levels.”According to DHS, “This week, Secretary Mayorkas will increase the required minimum spend on cybersecurity through FEMA grant awards. To accelerate critical improvements in state and local cybersecurity, CISA will urgently evaluate and implement additional capabilities including potential new grant programs that will enable critical security investments.”House Homeland Security Chairman Bennie Thompson (D-MS) and cyber subcommittee Chairwoman Yvette Clarke (D-NY) praised the move.“For several years, the Federal government has underestimated the cyber threats posed to state and local networks and neglected the federal government’s responsibility to help defend them. Inaction has proven costly for victims -- from Albany to Atlanta. And response to opportunistic breaches take the time away from defending against more sophisticated attacks,” Thompson and Clarke said Monday.“Make no mistake, the cybersecurity challenges faced by state and local governments is a national security issue. By making strategic investments in raising the baseline cybersecurity posture of state and local governments, we can help avoid opportunistic attacks against them and free up resources to defend against more sophisticated threats,” the Democrats said. “We are encouraged to see Secretary Mayorkas taking the cyber threats to state and local networks seriously and look forward to working with him on this important issue, particularly as we prepare to reintroduce the State and Local Cybersecurity Improvement Act.”DHS also said on Monday, “On Thursday, Secretary Mayorkas will speak at the President’s Cup Cybersecurity Competition and issue a call to action to build a diverse cybersecurity workforce and leverage DHS’s partnerships to tackle the growing risk from ransomware.”The department emphasized ongoing work to confront ransomware in partnership with other agencies and allies abroad.
